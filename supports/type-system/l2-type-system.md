# L2 Type System Design

This document fixes the design target for Pre-C03. It is an implementation contract for the level-1b L2 typed pass, not a user-facing tutorial.

Level-1 type checking is:

```text
HM inference
+ row constraints
+ checked structural templates
+ nominal identity
+ method/operator/shape obligations
+ capability and ABI legality
```

It is not a Rust-style trait solver, not a global witness search, and not an old C++ template model where the body is unchecked until instantiation.

## Pipeline Boundary

The L2 pass consumes alpha-resolved AST/CIR and produces:

- `TypedAst`: every expression, pattern, binder, item header, and call site has a type fact.
- `ConstraintSet`: equality, row, field, capability, and ABI constraints collected during checking.
- `ObligationIR`: deferred structural obligations that need concrete shape or method/operator lookup.
- `TypeSummary`: stable exported type headers for namespace/project checking.

The L2 pass must not lower to wasm and must not choose backend layouts. It may create canonical row and nominal ids because later passes need those ids for method lookup, specialization, and wasm-gc layout.

## Type Universe

The implementation should represent type data as explicit ADTs, not opaque `i64` handles.

Minimum type forms:

```text
TyVar(id)
TyConst(name)
TyApp(callee, args)
TyFn(params, result)
TyTuple(elements)
TyRow(row_id)
TyNominal(nominal_id, type_args)
TyData(data_id, type_args)
TyUnion(union_id, type_args)
TyRef(inner)
TyUnsafeRef(inner)
TyPtr(inner)
TyAtomic(inner)
TyContinuation(input, answer, kind)
TyNever
TyUnit
```

`String` is `Array[u8]`; `str` is `Slice[u8]`. The type checker may preserve the surface aliases for diagnostics, but canonical type comparison must use the normalized form.

## Type Variables

`[T]` is a type-variable binder.

It is user-visible, scoped to the item body, and may carry a bound:

```chiba
def f[T: {r | name: Str}](value: T): Str = value.name
```

The checker must record at least:

- `TyVarId`
- `origin`: user generic, implicit parameter, let-generalized variable, row tail, field result, compiler internal
- `level`: for let-generalization
- `kind`: value, row, capability, continuation, ABI scalar
- `visibility`: user-visible or synthetic
- `bounds`: row/named/capability obligations attached to this variable

Implicit variables are synthetic binders. They are still real type variables; they are not parser hacks and not erased diagnostics.

Examples:

```chiba
def id(x) = x
```

Elaborates after checking to something equivalent to:

```text
forall $T0. fn($T0) -> $T0
```

```chiba
def id[T](x: T): T = x
```

Elaborates to:

```text
forall T. fn(T) -> T
```

Both are polymorphic, but only the second exposes the name `T` to source-level diagnostics and future explicit instantiation syntax.

## ConstraintSet

Constraints that belong to HM/unification:

- equality: `A == B`
- function application shape: `callee == fn(args...) -> result`
- tuple element equality
- type application arity and kind checks
- concrete numeric/bool/string equality

Constraints that belong to row unification:

- row variable equals row
- open row contains field
- field type consistency
- closed row forbids extra fields

Constraints that are not plain HM equality:

- method lookup
- operator overload lookup on abstract operands
- shape dispatch
- dyn adapter packaging
- continuation resume legality
- ABI import/export legality

Those must become `ObligationIR` or dedicated capability/ABI checks. Collapsing them into equality would accidentally create structural subtyping or a hidden trait solver.

## Row Model

Rows are canonical shape facts.

Canonical row key:

```text
RowKey = (openness, stable_tail_id_or_none, sorted[(field_id, field_type_key)])
```

Rules:

- Source field order must not affect the row key.
- Field ids are stable across deterministic project scans.
- Tuple fields are generated as `_1`, `_2`, ...
- A nominal type may expose a row shape, but the nominal id remains separate.
- A row bound is a shape obligation, not nominal erasure.

Example:

```chiba
type User { name: Str, id: i64 }
type Device { id: i64, name: Str }
```

`User` and `Device` may share a normalized row shape key, but they must not share a nominal id. Method resolution defaults to nominal id, not row shape.

## Automatic Function Generalization

For ordinary non-`extern` functions:

```chiba
def f(a, b, c) = expr
```

Checking order:

1. Create fresh synthetic type variables for unannotated parameters.
2. Create a fresh result variable when return type is omitted.
3. Check the body under those variables.
4. Concrete uses unify immediately.
5. Field/method/operator/shape uses attach obligations.
6. Generalize free variables at the function boundary.

This is definition-time checking. The body is checked once under abstract variables and obligations. Only concrete obligation discharge is deferred.

Explicit generic binders and implicit variables may coexist:

```chiba
def pair_left[T](left: T, right) = left
```

`T` is user-visible. `right` receives a synthetic variable. The checker must not reject this merely because the function is generic.

## Let-Generalization

`let` can generalize only values that pass the value restriction.

Freely generalizable:

- immutable literals
- pure record/tuple values built from generalizable values
- functions/lambdas without unsafe or continuation escape
- pure aliases to already-generalized immutable values

Not freely generalizable:

- `Ref[T]`
- `UnsafeRef[T]`
- `Ptr[T]`
- `Atomic[T]`
- extern/FFI values
- unsafe-block results
- continuation-bearing values
- values that capture world-local state

This restriction prevents polymorphic mutable references and polymorphic control capabilities.

## Checked Template Split

Definition-time checks:

- parse/alpha/name-resolve well-formedness
- explicit and implicit generic binder validity
- ordinary HM unification
- row bound well-formedness
- field obligation creation
- method/operator obligation creation
- return type consistency
- capability syntax legality
- basic answer/control entry facts needed by later continuation pass

Instantiation-time checks:

- concrete row field existence and field type consistency
- concrete method candidate resolution
- concrete operator resolution
- shape-dispatch final candidate selection
- dyn adapter packaging
- builtin capability facts that depend on concrete type
- continuation capability facts that depend on concrete use

Definition-time must reject errors that do not depend on concrete type.

```chiba
def bad[T](x: T) = 1 + true
```

This fails during definition-time checking.

```chiba
def get_name(x) = x.name
```

This succeeds at definition time by producing a field obligation. A later instantiation fails if the concrete argument has no `name` field.

## Method And Operator Boundary

Method resolution is not row unification.

The L2 pass should create a method index:

```text
(nominal_id, method_name) -> method candidates
```

Method-call resolution uses three paths:

1. Field-callable: `receiver.method` is a field value that can be called.
2. Nominal receiver method: `def Type.method(self, ...)`.
3. Qualified callee: an explicitly named function path.

The chosen path must be recorded in TypedAst. If the receiver is abstract and cannot be decided yet, L2 records a `MethodObligation`.

Operator checking:

- concrete builtin numeric/bool operators unify immediately
- abstract operands produce `OperatorObligation`
- invalid concrete combinations fail at definition time

## Capability And ABI Boundary

Capability types are ordinary type forms with extra legality rules:

- `Ref[T]` is the safe mutation entry.
- `UnsafeRef[T]` and `Ptr[T]` require explicit `unsafe` context.
- `Atomic[T]` is limited to the supported scalar/pointer-like family.
- top-level `Ref[T]` requires `#[world_local]`.
- non-Metal source without an explicit unsafe boundary cannot mention `UnsafeRef[T]` or `Ptr[T]`, including in ordinary parameter or return annotations.

Assignment:

```text
lhs := rhs
requires lhs : Ref[T], rhs : T
```

Element assignment is legal only when the indexed expression itself has type `Ref[T]`; `Ref[Array[T]]` does not make array elements mutable.

Extern declarations require explicit ABI types:

```chiba
def fd_write(fd: i64, iov: i64, iovcnt: i64, nwritten: i64): i64 =
    extern "wasi" "fd_write"
```

The backend consumes typed import refs. It must not infer ABI signatures during WAT/Core emission.

## Required Dumps

L2 must be able to dump:

- user and synthetic type variables
- substitutions
- final item type schemes
- canonical row keys
- nominal ids
- constraints before/after solve
- obligations
- selected method/operator path when known

The dump order must be deterministic. This is part of the type checker contract, not debug-only behavior.

## Unsoundness Audit

Known unsoundness risks and required guardrails:

- **Polymorphic refs**: unrestricted let-generalization over `Ref[T]` allows writing one type and reading another. Guardrail: value restriction.
- **Nominal erasure by row**: treating `{r | ...}` as the real type erases method identity and layout identity. Guardrail: row shape and nominal id are separate facts.
- **Hidden structural subtyping**: accepting arbitrary row subsumption at any position creates unstable method/dispatch behavior. Guardrail: row unification only at explicit row/generic boundaries.
- **Unchecked templates**: deferring the whole generic body to instantiation hides definition errors. Guardrail: definition-time HM and well-formedness are mandatory.
- **Method as field fallback ambiguity**: silently choosing field-callable or receiver method can change behavior. Guardrail: fixed candidate order and ambiguity diagnostics.
- **Operator inference too eager**: defaulting unconstrained `+` to `i64` can reject valid generic code or hide operator obligations. Guardrail: concrete operands solve immediately; abstract operands produce obligations.
- **Synthetic generic leakage**: compiler-generated `$T0` names must not become stable user syntax. Guardrail: expose only in diagnostics/dumps, not in source namespaces.
- **ABI inference**: inferring extern signatures from call sites can produce wrong imports. Guardrail: extern requires explicit ABI types.
- **Continuation generalization**: freely generalizing captured continuations can cross answer/world boundaries. Guardrail: continuation-bearing values are not freely generalized; later answer/control pass owns the detailed legality check.
- **Unsafe capability leakage through annotations**: allowing ordinary signatures to mention `Ptr[T]` or `UnsafeRef[T]` without unsafe context makes unsafe values callable from safe code. Guardrail: annotations are checked as capability uses, and Metal still uses typed `Ptr[T]` rather than raw pointer-shaped `i64`.
